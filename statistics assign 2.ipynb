    "Measures of dispersion, such as range, variance, and standard deviation, are used to describe the spread or variability of a dataset. \n",
    "They provide information about how the data points are distributed around the measures of central tendency, such as the mean or median. \n",
    "Here's how these measures are used and an example to illustrate their application:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Range: The range is the simplest measure of dispersion and represents the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset. \n",
    "It gives an idea of how widely the data values are spread out. However, the range alone does not provide information about the\n",
    "distribution of values within that range. For example, if the range is large, it indicates a wide spread, whereas a small range suggests \n",
    "a more concentrated distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Consider a dataset of exam scores for a class: [70, 75, 80, 85, 90]. The range is calculated as the\n",
    "difference between the maximum (90) and minimum (70) scores, which gives a range of 20. This indicates that the scores are spread out \n",
    "over a range of 20 points.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Variance: Variance measures the average squared deviation from the mean. It quantifies the spread of data by calculating\n",
    "how far each data point deviates from the mean and then averaging the squared deviations. A higher variance implies greater variability in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Continuing with the previous example, the mean score is 80. The squared deviations from the mean are calculated as follows:\n",
    "    (70-80)^2, (75-80)^2, (80-80)^2, (85-80)^2, (90-80)^2. Summing up these squared deviations and dividing by the number of data points (5)\n",
    "    gives a variance of 50. This indicates that the scores have a spread around the mean of 80.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Standard Deviation: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance and provides a measure of dispersion in the original\n",
    "units of the dataset. It is commonly used as it has the same unit of measurement as the data points, making it easier to interpret.\n",
    "A higher standard deviation implies a greater spread or variability in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Using the previous example, the standard deviation is the square root of the variance. Taking the square root of 50 gives\n",
    "a standard deviation of approximately 7.07. This indicates that the scores have a spread around the mean of 80, with most scores falling within \n",
    "approximately 7.07 points of the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, measures of dispersion like range, variance, and standard deviation provide insights into how the data is spread out \n",
    "around the central tendency. They help understand the variability or spread of values in a dataset and provide a way to quantify and \n",
    "compare the degree of dispersion among different datasets."

Their presence can distort the overall picture of the data and affect the summary statistics. Here's how outliers can influence these measures:\n",

    "- Mode: Outliers typically have no impact on the mode since it represents the most frequently occurring value(s). \n",
    "Outliers are usually distant from the mode and have a minimal effect on its calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Measures of Dispersion:\n",
    "- Range: Outliers can significantly affect the range since it is determined by the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the dataset.\n",
    "If an outlier is extremely large or small, it can widen the range substantially.\n",
    "- Variance: Outliers can increase the variance since it measures the average squared deviation from the mean. Outliers with large deviations \n",
    "from the mean can contribute significantly to the overall variance.\n",
    "- Standard Deviation: Similar to variance, outliers can increase the standard deviation. As it is the square root of the variance, \n",
    "outliers with large deviations from the mean can amplify the effect on the standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Consider the following dataset representing the salaries (in thousands) of employees in a company: [40, 45, 42, 39, 41, 200].\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mean: The presence of the outlier \"200\" significantly increases the mean, pulling it towards the higher end of the scale.\n",
    "- Median: The median is less affected by the outlier since it represents the middle value. In this case, it remains around \n",
    "the middle value of the non-outlier salaries.\n",
    "- Mode: The mode is unaffected since there is no repetition of values.\n",
    "- Range: The range is heavily influenced by the outlier, as it expands from 39 to 200.\n",
    "- Variance: The outlier increases the variance, as it introduces a large squared deviation from the mean.\n",
    "- Standard Deviation: Similar to variance, the standard deviation is increased due to the outlier's large deviation from the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the outlier significantly impacts the measures of central tendency and dispersion, skewing the results and\n",
