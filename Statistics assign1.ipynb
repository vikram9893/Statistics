    "Ans 2 There are two main types of statistics: descriptive statistics and inferential statistics. Let's define each type and provide examples of when they might be used:\n",
    "\n",
    "Descriptive Statistics:\n",
    "Descriptive statistics involves summarizing, organizing, and presenting data in a meaningful way. \n",
    "It aims to describe the main features of a data set without making any inferences or generalizations beyond the data itself. \n",
    "Descriptive statistics include measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode), measures of dispersion (standard deviation, range), \n",
    "and graphical representations (histograms, bar charts, pie charts).\n",
    "Example: Suppose you have collected the heights of a group of individuals. Descriptive statistics can be used to calculate the average height (mean), \n",
    "the most common height (mode), and the typical range of heights (standard deviation). \n",
    "These measures would provide a concise summary of the group's height distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inferential Statistics:\n",
    "Inferential statistics involves using sample data to make inferences or draw conclusions about a larger population. \n",
    "It uses probability theory and statistical techniques to make predictions, test hypotheses, and estimate population parameters based on sample statistics.\n",
    "Inferential statistics allows researchers to make generalizations and draw meaningful insights from a subset of the data.\n",
    "Example: Imagine a pharmaceutical company developing a new drug. They conduct a clinical trial with a sample of patients and use inferential statistics\n",
    "to determine if the drug is effective and safe for the larger population. By analyzing the data from the sample, \n",

    "There are four main types of data: nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio. These types differ based on the nature of the data and\n",
    "the level of measurement. Let's define each type and provide examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Nominal Data:\n",
    "Nominal data represents categories or labels without any inherent order or numerical value.\n",
    "It involves qualitative or categorical variables where the data points are distinct and cannot be ranked. \n",
    "Nominal data can only be categorized into groups or classes.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. Ordinal Data:\n",
    "Ordinal data has categories that can be ordered or ranked based on some criteria. It represents qualitative or categorical variables with a natural order or \n",

    "The categories can be ordered based on the level of education achieved, but the differences between the categories may not be equal or easily quantified.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Interval Data:\n",
    "Interval data represents numerical data where the differences between the values are meaningful and consistent, but there is no true zero point.\n",
    "The intervals between values are equal and can be measured, but ratios are not meaningful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Temperature measured in Celsius or Fahrenheit is interval data. The differences between 10°C and 20°C are the same as\n",
    "the differences between 20°C and 30°C, but a temperature of 0°C does not represent a complete absence of heat.\n",

    "Ratio data is similar to interval data but has a true zero point, indicating the absence of the measured attribute.\n",
    "Ratios between values are meaningful, and arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division can be performed on the data.\n",

    "Example: Age, weight, and height are examples of ratio data. A person's weight of 60 kg is twice the weight of someone who weighs 30 kg,\n",

    "Levels of measurement, also known as scales of measurement or levels of data, refer to the different ways in which data can be measured and categorized. There are four commonly recognized levels of measurement: nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio. Each level has specific characteristics that determine the types of statistical analysis and operations that can be applied to the data. Let's explain each level and provide an example variable for each:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Nominal Level:\n",
    "Nominal level measurement involves the simplest form of categorization or classification of data. \n",
    "Variables at the nominal level are qualitative or categorical, where data points are assigned to distinct categories without \n",

    "2. Ordinal Level:\n",
    "Ordinal level measurement allows for the categorization of data into distinct categories with an inherent order or ranking. \n",
